GROUP NAME

The "A" Team

 
DESCRIPTION

 Our group understands that learning outside of the classroom is a crucial part of a students education
 and success. We wish to help bring the parents into the equation so they can take an active role in the education of
 their child. Our app will allow students themselves and their parents to enter their individual SOL scores so they can compare their 
 score with the average scores of not only their school but also other schools in the state so they can pinpoint areas of weakness and 
 improve their scores. The app will gather information of a particular school and grade levels previous SOL data so that parents and/or
 students can see where they are excelling or doing poorly in. With this information parents would know where they can and should aid in 
 their child's studies. The app would also offer alternative activities based on different learning styles that could
 better help the student grasp the content.  Parents could download study plans for specific areas.
